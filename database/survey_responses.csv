I was anxious, felt alone and lonely that time when my hand started running through my hair looking for coarse hair and then pulled. I felt relieved on something in my mind, maybe relieved from the anxiety I felt at that moment.  Trichotillomania has made my social life miserable. It has given very low self-esteem. I haven't have any self-confidence to face people. I feel uncomfortable around people. I feel dumb and ignorant on things. But at home, I am myself, though I wear hats all the time but my family knows my situation, they know I have trich and have tried to help minimize my pulling.;2025-04-28T09:51:46.596204

Undiagnosed: Dermatillomania;8;No;N/A;I spend hours at a time picking. Time flies past ridiculously fast. It feels like I'm forced to pick/pluck. I always tell myself I'm not going to, but somehow convince myself into grabbing the tweezers. If I don't have tweezers at my disposal, I will end up with calluses on my finger from digging my nails into them over and over to try to pluck hairs. Less damage is done to the area, but more to my hands. I've had my mom yell at me over it for a good while of my life and my step dad would tell me to stop picking too. These gestures actually made it worse for me because they shamed me and also made me experience PDA, which is an aspect/comorbidity symptom of Autism. I have an obsessive urge to remove hairs that are out of place or that aren't perfect according to my rigid standards. My issue started as a form of stress release/daydreaming/stimming when I was young. My mom used to pick her face and actually encouraged/taught me how to pick mine. She has since stopped but I continue without being able to stop for very long. ;2025-04-29T11:35:44.348919
